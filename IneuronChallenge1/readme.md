# Crime Analysis report:

Crime analysis is a law enforcement duty that involves a systematic investigation of patterns and trends in crime and disorder. Pattern information can help law enforcement organizations deploy resources more effectively and aid detectives in locating and apprehending criminals. Crime analysis is also important in developing answers to crime problems and developing crime prevention methods.
Our project will help Baton Rouge Police Department in understanding the current pattern in data available in Power BI visuals and help them to be more aware and eradicate any suspected incidents that might happen in the future within the city at any given address and at any given daytime.
